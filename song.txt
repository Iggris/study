Cut me like those words you throw
Console me when you want control
Roll me in those lies you've told
But I won't play these games no more and

(Don't run and hide, stand up and fight)
I'm feeling like just letting go
(It's shaking your mind with cause and divide)
It's taking everything I know
(Don't run and hide, stand up inside)
The wheels keep burning
I'm about ready to blow!
